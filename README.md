# Project Euler

These are my submissions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. My goal is to do these problems with as little research as possible.
However, I do not know everything and so will likely come to a point where I do need to look something up. The problems that have been researched will
be properly notated. The ones that are not researched are likely to be poorly optimized, with the researched ones likely to be optimized.
